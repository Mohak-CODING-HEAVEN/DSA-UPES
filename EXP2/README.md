## Contains: 

- Find the transpose and Inverse of a matrix.
- Find if the given matrix of order (m x n) is a Sparse matrix or not. [Assume that a matrix can become a sparse matrix if more than half the total number of its elements have the value zero]
- Store ‘n’ numbers (integers or real) in an array in ascending or descending order. Conduct a binary search for a given number and report success or failure in the form of a suitable message.
- Find out the largest and smallest number in a given array.
- Create an array ‘a1’ with ‘n’ elements.
  - Copy all elements of ‘a1’ into another array ‘a2’ using pointers. Display the contents of both the arrays using pointers.
  - Merge the contents of ‘a1’ and ‘a2’ into a new array ‘a3’.
- Find the total number of alphabets, digits or special characters in a string.
- Find whether the entered string is palindrome or not.
- Count the number of words in a string.
- Design a structure ‘product’ to store the details of the product purchased like product name, price per unit, the number of quantities purchased, and amount spent. Get the name, price per unit, and the number of quantities of the product purchased. Calculate the amount spent on the product and then display all the details of the procured product using structure pointers.
- Design a structure ‘student_record’ to store student details like name, SAP ID, enrollment number, date of registration and date of birth. The element date of joining is defined using another structure ‘date’ to store date details like day, month, and year. Get data of ‘n’ students and then print the entered values [Hint: Use concept of Nested structures and Array of Structures].
- Add two complex numbers by passing structure to a function as an argument.

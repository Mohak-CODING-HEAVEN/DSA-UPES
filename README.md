# Data Structures and Algorithm, UPES

This repository contains all the Lab experiments I have performed while learning the course Data Structures and Algorithm at UPES.

Contents :

1. **Arrays** - operations on 1D & 2D arrays
2. **Structure and Unions**
3. **Single Linked Lists** : Insertion (beginning/middle/end) and Deletion (beginning/middle/end)
4. **Doubly Linked Lists and it's operations** (same operations as of single linked lists)
5. **Stack Implementation using linked list** and stack operations
6. **String operations using stack**
7. **Circular Queue with Arrays**
8. **Queue using Stack**
9. **Bubble Sort**
10. **Insertion Sort**
11. **Selection Sort**
12. **Binary and Linear Search**
13. **Binary Search Tree** implementation with insertion, deletion and searching
14. **Hash Table** implementation
15. **Heap Sort** implementation

### **Experiment 1 :**

1. Find sum of all array elements using recursion, iteration.
2. Create an array ‘a1’ with ‘n’ elements. Insert an element in ith position
   of ‘a1’ and also delete an element from jth position of ‘a1’.
3. Convert uppercase string to lowercase using for loop.
4. Find the sum of rows and columns of matrix of given order (row x
   column).
5. Find the product of two matrices using pointers.
6. Store ‘n’ numbers (integers or real) in an array. Conduct a linear search for a given number and report success or failure in the form of a suitable message.
